## **Introduction to regular expressions in JavaScript** 

A regular expression is a string that describes a pattern e.g., **email addresses** and **mail numbers.**

In JavaScript, **regular expressions are objects**. JavaScript provides the **built-in** RegExp type that allows you to work with regular expressions effectively.

Regular expressions are useful for searching and replacing strings that match a pattern. They have many useful applications.

For example, you can use regular expressions to extract useful information in web scraping like product prices. Or you can use regular expressions to validate form fields like email addresses and mail numbers. 

**Creating a regular expression.**
To create a regular expression in JavaScript, you enclose its pattern in forward-slash `(/)` characters like this:

```javascript
let re = /hi/;
``` 

>🛑 Note: 👉  a regular expression doesn’t have single quotes or double quotes like a regular string. 

Or you can use the RegExp constructor: 

```javascript
let re = new RegExp('hi');
``` 

Both regular expressions are the instances of the RegExp type. They match the string `'hi'`. 


**Testing for matching** 

The **RegExp object** has many useful **methods**. One of them is the **`test()`** method that allows you to test if a string contains a match of the pattern in the regular expression.

👉 The **test()** method returns `true` if the string argument contains a **match**.

The following example shows how to use the `test()`  method:

```javascript 
let re = /hi/;
let result = re.test('hi Anna');

console.log(result); 
``` 

> Returns true 


**Using pattern flags**

Besides a pattern, a **RegExp** object also accepts an optional flag parameter. Flags are settings that change the searching behavior.

**1) The ignore flag (i)**
Regular expressions have many flags. For example, the ignore or `i` flag ignores cases when searching.

By default, searches are **case-sensitive**. For example `/hi/` only matches the string `hi` not Hi, or HI.

To search for a string with any cases, you use the `i` flag:


```javascript 
 let re = /hi/i;
let result = re.test('Hi John');

console.log(result); 
```

> In this example, the /hi/i will match any string hi, Hi, and HI.

The following shows how to use the pattern flag in the **RegExp constructor**:

```javascript 

let re = new RegExp('hi','i');
let result = re.test('HI Anna');

console.log(result); // true
``` 

**2) The global flag (g).**

Another commonly used flag is the **global or g flag**.

👉 Without the **global flag**, the RegExp object only checks if there is a match in a string and returns the first match.

When the g flag is available, the RegExp looks for all matches and returns all of them.


It’s possible to combine flags e.g., gi flags combine the ignore (i) and the global flag (g) flags.


The **`exec()`** method of the RegExp performs a search for a match in a string and returns an array that contains detailed information about the match.


The **`exec()`** method returns null if it could not find any match. However, it returns a single match at once. To get all matches, you need to execute the exec() multiple times.


The following example uses the **`exec()`** method with a **while loop** to return all the matches: 

```javascript
let message = 'Hi, are you there? hi, HI...';
let re = /hi/gi;

let matches = [];
let match;
do {
    match = re.exec(message);
    if(match) {
      matches.push(match);
    }
} while(match != null)

console.dir(matches);
``` 

**How it works:**

 - First, **declare a message string** that will be used for searching.

 - Then, create a regular expression object with the pattern /hi/gi. The ignore flag `(i)` allows re object to ignore cases when executing the search and the global flag `(g)` instructs the re object to find all matches, not just the first one.
 - Third, execute the `exec()` method until no match found.

 - Finally, show the result array in the console.

**Searching strings**

The method str.match(regexp) returns all matches of regexp in the string str.

To find all matches, you use the global flag (g). And to find the matches regardless of cases, you use the ignore flag (i).

The following example shows how to use the match() method:

```javascript
let str = "Are you Ok? Yes, I'm OK";
let result = str.match(/OK/gi);

console.log(result);
```

Output:
```
["Ok", "OK"]
```
